[env:genericSTM32F103C8]
platform = ststm32
board = genericSTM32F103C8
framework = arduino
; mykemod
; upload_protocol, default is stlink (little blue device)
; but we want to use our sick USB bootloader
upload_protocol = dfu
; STM32 have two alternative cores, developed independantly (sigh!)
; https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/ststm32.html#switching-between-arduino-cores
board_build.core = maple ; Official arduino core is more popular, I believe
; board_build.core = STM32Duino ; alternative, faster dev development but buggy on upload!
monitor_speed = 9600
